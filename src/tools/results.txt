Infy Adr 50% spike says...

What infy adr spike said?
Was it technical glitch? Was it Pump & Dump (just guessing)? 

Google says:
Explanation of the Spike
Technical Glitch: Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the 'INFY' ticker, potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive, self-reinforcing buy orders.
Short Squeeze: Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers. The sudden, forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply.
Low Liquidity: The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent, amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price. 
Key Takeaways
Fundamentals Unchanged: Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement, confirming the company's fundamentals remained stable.
Domestic Market Disconnect: The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market. The company's shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7% on the same day, reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly.
Regulatory Scrutiny: The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity, prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC. 

Then why infy adr declining??

Title: New Year Resolution: Invest for a Developed India — Let Rent-Seekers Make Profits, But Don’t Give PE or PS to Body Shoppers, Packaging, Delivery, Banking, Broking, Insurance, Painting, or Noodles. 2047 Will Not Forgive Us If We Give PE to Rent-Seekers and Let CEOs of Non-Innovative Companies Amass

Here is what actually happens when you let these people make far more money than they deserve.

Let’s say Infosys makes a profit of ₹100 by leeching off cheap labor and subcontracting.  
Let’s say Asian Paints makes ₹100 by squeezing dealers and fooling retailers.  
Let’s say Nestlé makes ₹100 by cutting corners and selling questionable food.

The real problem is not that they make profits.  
The real problem is that their stocks trade at **80–100× PE**.

For every ₹1 of profit, the CEO and early, large “Lala ji” shareholders make **₹100 or ₹1,000** when they sell shares — **using YOUR SIP money**.

Lala ji does **not** deserve this level of reward.

He did not fund research for decades.  
He did not build labs.  
He did not lose money running 10 failed R&D projects.  
He did not solve hard scientific or engineering problems.

What did he do instead?  
He went on TV barking about ROCE, asset-light models, and 70-hour work weeks.

Does Lala ji’s grandson deserve generational wealth for this?  
Absolutely not.

At best, Lala ji deserves what the business earns — maybe twice that in good years.  
But your SIP, your IPO money, and blind indexing reward him **1,000× his actual contribution**.

He sells shares.  
He leverages them.  
He buys yachts, elephants, mansions, and foreign assets for his children.

That is what happens when rent-seekers get access to your SIP money.

These companies are **not capital-starved**.  
They are sitting on massive cash piles.

They could have invested in real innovation.  
They could have funded deep research.  
They could have backed companies like **OpenAI** years ago.

And here is the most damning part: **Infosys actually was an early investor in OpenAI.**

But in **2018**, MOHANDAS PAI AND ALL LALA SHAREHOLDERS like maheswari and agarwals   forced Infosys to **sell its OpenAI stake**.  
  
Because they wanted quarterly EPS comfort.



Infosys exited **before ChatGPT**, before GPT-4, before the AI boom —



Dividends and buybacks do **not** help people like you and me.  
We make real money only when companies **10× through innovation**, not when ₹2 dividends are paid.

Dividends are for large, early shareholders who already own crores worth of stock.  


This constant cash extraction is exactly why India remains an **importer**, not an innovator.

As long as rent-seekers keep getting premium valuations for zero innovation, **2047 will not forgive this**.

Infosys ADR witnessed a sharp intraday surge of nearly 50% before settling and closing approximately 5% higher. There is significant speculation regarding the potential impact of this movement on Infosys shares listed on Indian exchanges.

Some market participants expect a sharp opening near ₹2,000, while others believe the stock may open with a moderate gain of around 4–5%. Given the widespread discussions and panic across social media platforms, I request experienced market participants to share their insights based on historical precedents and past ADR–domestic price linkages.

1) Due to some Mapping issue Infy had surged in ADRs for last two days... Seeing Infy all other ADRs also rose 😂.. 

Now the news is out and even infy gave clarification on NSE and other exchanges that there is no material event.

2) This also coincided with Quadaruple withching Which made everything rise for no reason along with short squeeze.

3) From Monday it's better to exit before it shoots down as opposed to everyones expectation of sky rocketing...

4) Feel even Nifty will be bearish till Christmas... And anyone hoping for Santa rally it happens after once people return from vacation not before in case anyone is still mastakibg it for one.
